## Beta:
- Multiplayer support.
- Revamped gameplay:
  - Each player controls a cube. WASD + FGH for movement + jumping + shooting + laying platforms for player 1, OK;l + []\ for player 2.
  - There are humans on the ground that both players must protect. Aliens fire from above.
  - There are two classes: "Builder" and "Fighter". To change classes, hit either the left(builder) or right box(fighter).
  - The only way to kill aliens is to deflect their bullets while in fighter mode. H + \ will create a shield around you. At the moment, it's unlimited but in the final version it will be charged and limited by time.
  - Builders can place platforms that allow the fighters to jump up and get closer to the aliens. They also protect the humans from incoming fire. However, they require wood. Wood is dropped by aliens when killed by their own bullets.
  - Fighters can also run into enemies while their shield is up. This will kill them automatically, but will NOT drop any wood.
  - 0 switches the camera to a 3d view.

  - The game uses an orthographic camera, which i decided will fit the theme of a platforming shoot-em-up game better.
